  1. Go to the AWS CloudFront Console

Navigate to CloudFront â†’ Click Create Distribution.
Configure Origin Settings

Origin Domain â†’ Enter your ALB's DNS name (e.g., App-Server-Loadbalancer-xyz.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com).
Origin Protocol Policy â†’ Choose HTTPS only for secure traffic.
Allowed HTTP Methods â†’ Choose GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE (for full support).
Enable Origin Shield â†’ (Optional, but recommended for reducing requests to origin).
Set Default Cache Behavior

Viewer Protocol Policy â†’ Select Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.
Allowed HTTP Methods â†’ Select GET, HEAD, OPTIONS for static content.
Forward Headers â†’ Choose All if your app requires it.
Object Caching â†’ Use Managed-CachingOptimized for standard caching behavior.
Add Alternate Domain Names (Optional)

If using a custom domain, add it here and configure an SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager.

Click Create Distribution and wait for it to deploy.
Note the CloudFront Distribution Domain Name (e.g., d123.cloudfront.net).
